            There are 3 basic types of motherboards ATX, MATX, ITX. 
        </p>
        <p>
            ATX motherboards are the biggest of the three and typically come with more graphic card and SSD slots.
        </p>
        <p>
            MATX(My favorite) are the little brother of the ATX, they lack some of the slots of ATX but are typically cheaper. Because MATX is smaller it can save you plenty of desk space.
        </p>
        <p>
            ITX is the smallest of the bunch. They also have two less ram slots then ATX or MATX. They are also harder to build on. Despite their size they are very expensive. I would advise beginners to avoid ITX.
